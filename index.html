    <h1><center>BIOGRAPHY</center></h1>
    <p>
      I am Chukwuonwe Mukaosolu, graduated in January 2023 from Olusegun Agagu
      University of Science and Technology Okitipupa, with a B.tech in Computer
      Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hail from Enugu State, both parents are from Enugu State, i grew up in
      lagos, Ikorodu to be precise. for a typical ikorodu girl you would expect
      my social life should be way above the roof. sadly i stay indoors, watch
      movies, read books, and make sure i eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been a computer science student for 5years, i had constantly
      researched my dicipline to know what i woudld specialize in after
      graduation. over time i could say my interest had changed. At first i had
      always wanted to be a software engineer but specialize in Back-end cos i
      fell in love with Python üòÅ, then i started my self learning journey and
      guess i wanted more, i dived into Front-end i was loving it, i was having
      fun doing what i always wanted but still i felt something was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the present i somehow stumbled into cloud engineering, devops and i was
      amazed üòÆ. even after registering as a Front-end engineer i want to switch
      into cloud engineering, i feel i have finally connected with what i
      actually want to do, and i am going to do my best to achieve it.
